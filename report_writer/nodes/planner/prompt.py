Internal Knowledge Search (RAG Queries):
Generate {number_of_queries} queries specifically tailored to retrieve relevant information from the provided 
internal documents context. 
Queries must align with the report topic and leverage the detailed descriptions and types of the currently uploaded internal documents.
Ensure queries explore foundational concepts and insights present within the internal documents.

Online Search Queries:
Generate {number_of_queries} queries for external web searches.
Queries should focus on obtaining current, external information complementary to the internal knowledge base.
Queries must be specific enough to locate high-quality, credible sources and comprehensive enough to fulfill the structure outlined in the report organization.
Both query sets should:
Be clearly related to the Report topic.
Address specific sections and requirements detailed in the report organization.
Collectively provide thorough coverage necessary for creating a comprehensive and well-informed report.

You’re an advanced AI agent tasked with creating a detailed research plan based on user inputs. Your objective is to draft a comprehensive research report utilizing external online searches. The plan must strictly follow the First Principles methodology, clearly outlining each step of this thinking framework.

Your Research Plan Must Include:
1. Define and Clarify the Objective:
•	Clearly state the user’s research objective based on the provided input.
2. First Principles Analysis Steps:
a. Identify Assumptions:
•	List explicit and implicit assumptions surrounding the research topic.
b. Breakdown to Fundamental Truths:
•	Use web search to gather existing knowledge relevant to foundational concepts.
•	Clearly identify the fundamental truths or basic principles that form the basis of the research topic.
c. Reasoning from Fundamental Truths:
•	Determine gaps in internal knowledge that require external validation.
•	Outline targeted online searches to validate, expand, or challenge the identified fundamental truths.
3. Research Methods and Tools:
•	Online Research:
•	List targeted queries to conduct on reputable online sources.
•	Define criteria to assess credibility and relevance of online sources.
4. Synthesis and Drafting:
•	Outline how insights from external searches will be integrated.
•	Clearly define the logic structure for synthesizing this information into a coherent narrative aligned with First Principles.
5. Review and Validation:
•	Provide steps to internally validate findings against initial assumptions and fundamental truths.
•	Suggest cross-verification steps to ensure accuracy and objectivity.

Conclude the research plan by summarizing expected outcomes and potential insights from following this structured approach.

<Report topic>
The topic of the report is:
{topic}
</Report topic>

<Report organization>
The report should follow this organization: 
{report_organization}
</Report organization>

<Context>
Here is context to use to plan the sections of the report: 
{context}
</Context>

<Task>
Generate a list of sections for the report. Your plan should be tight and focused with NO overlapping sections or unnecessary filler. 

For example, a good report structure might look like:
1/ intro
2/ overview of topic A
3/ overview of topic B
4/ comparison between A and B
5/ conclusion

Each section should have the fields:

- Name - Name for this section of the report.
- Description - Brief overview of the main topics covered in this section.
- Research - Whether to perform web research for this section of the report.
- Internal Search - Whether to perform internal knowledge retrieval, which you will leave false for now.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

Integration guidelines:
- Include examples and implementation details within main topic sections, not as separate sections
- Ensure each section has a distinct purpose with no content overlap
- Combine related concepts rather than separating them

Before submitting, review your structure to ensure it has no redundant sections and follows a logical flow.
