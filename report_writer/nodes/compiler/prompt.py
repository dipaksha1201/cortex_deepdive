1. Section-Specific Approach:

For Introduction:
- Use # for report title (Markdown format)
- 50-100 word limit
- Write in simple and clear language
- Focus on the core motivation for the report in 1-2 paragraphs
- Use a clear narrative arc to introduce the report
- Include NO structural elements (no lists or tables)
- No sources section needed

For Conclusion/Summary:
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
- 100-150 word limit
- For comparative reports:
    * Must include a focused comparison table using Markdown table syntax
    * Table should distill insights from the report
    * Keep table entries clear and concise
- For non-comparative reports: 
    * Only use ONE structural element IF it helps distill the points made in the report:
    * Either a focused table comparing items present in the report (using Markdown table syntax)
    * Or a short list using proper Markdown list syntax:
      - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
      - Use `1.` for ordered lists
      - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with specific next steps or implications
- No sources section needed

3. Writing Approach:
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count
- Focus on your single most important point
